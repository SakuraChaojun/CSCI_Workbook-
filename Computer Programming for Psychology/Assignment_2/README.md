#### Print exercises
1. Save the script as [chaojun.py](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/chaojun.py)

2. If we only type the print command, there are no variables shown in the editor

---


#### Operation exercises

1. In Python 3.9 environments, the output is the same ( result: 2.5).

2. The modulo operator ( % ) returns the remainder of dividing two numbers. for example 10%3 = 1 

3. '\**' means exponent - left operand raised to the power of right. for example, 10\**2 = 100. '//' means to return the closest integer value which is less than or equal to a specified expression or value. for example, 13//2 = 6

4. Yes, Python follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators. for example, 1+2+3*5\/3 = 8

#### Variable exercises

1. Edit the script so that each letter is labeled as a separate variable in this format [chaojun_modify.py](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/chaojun%20modify.py)

2. Yes, there are seven variables shown in the editor. 

3. There are not any repeated letters in my name: Python has no problem with two different variables having the same value.

5. The value of letterX does not change the value of the other variable(s).

6. Changing the value of letter1 does not change the value of letterX. Python variable assignments follow a sequential order, and changing variables after the assignment does not affect the assigned variable.

#### Boolean exercises

1. 1 and 1.0 are equal because both of them is a numbers. '1' and '1.0' are not equal because they are strings, not exactly the same. 

2. The number 5 and equation (3+2) are equivalent in the Python environment.

3. Write out the statements [boolean](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/boolean_exercises.py)

#### List exercises

1. Yes, the [odd list](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/list_exercises.py) becomes a variable. 

2. [1,3,5,7,9](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/list_exercises.py)

3. When I use the "len" function on odd list, the return value is 5

4. When I use the "type" function on the odd list, the return type is the list.

5. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/list_exercises.py)

6. It lists all integers between 0 and 100
---
#### Dictionary exercises

1. Create a dictionary called ["about_me"](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/dictionary_exercises.py)

3. 4,Python determines the length of a dictionary according to the number of keys.

---


#### Array exercises

1. The Three integers convert to float format in this [array](https://github.com/SakuraChaojun/selected-courses/blob/main/Computer%20Programming%20for%20Psychology/Assignment_2/array_exercises.py). 

2. All elements force convert to string format in this array. Python requires the type in the array must be the same. Otherwise, force converts the data type to the same.
