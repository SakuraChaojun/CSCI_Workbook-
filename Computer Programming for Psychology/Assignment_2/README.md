2. The modulo operator ( % ) returns the remainder of dividing two numbers. for example 10%3 = 1 

3. '\**' means exponent - left operand raised to the power of right. for example, 10\**2 = 100. '//' means to return the closest integer value which is less than or equal to a specified expression or value. for example, 13//2 = 6
