### Final Project

#### Introduction

The main idea of this experiment is to explore the participant's visual search performance in the triangle shape. This experiment is a classic search task for a target among some number of distractors. The response time (RT, reaction time) increases roughly linearly with the number of shapes shown. However, locating the target presence objects and target absence objects is not exhibit the same performance (Wolfe, 2020). This experiment examined the participant's performance in the two groups: Group 1: locate the target-presence objects; group 2: locate the target-absence objects.

#### Methods
The experiment only has two blocks for demonstration, and each block has four trials. Participants need to locate the target shape as soon as possible. Press 'Q' means they found the target shape and 'P' for not. The odd number block is the target shape that appears, and the even number block is the target shape that disappears. 

In each trial, the shape, position and number are random, but the size and orientation is fixed.
